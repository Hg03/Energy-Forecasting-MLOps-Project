# Data Validation for Quality and Integrity using GE. Model Performance Continuous Monitoring

This tutorial represents **lesson 5 out of a 7-lesson course** that will walk you step-by-step through how to **design, implement, and deploy an ML system** using **MLOps good practices**. During the course, you will build a production-ready model to forecast energy consumption levels for the next 24 hours across multiple consumer types from Denmark.

By the end of this course, you will understand all the fundamentals of designing, coding and deploying an ML system using a batch-serving architecture.

This course targets mid/advanced machine learning engineers who want to level up their skills by building their own end-to-end projects.
